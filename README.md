## 🚀 Why TabWeaver?

Do you often find yourself with dozens of tabs open, only to feel lost in a sea of information?
- **Information Overload**: Hard to distinguish which pages are relevant and which can be safely closed.
- **Fragmented Reading**: Jumping between tabs disrupts your flow and prevents holistic understanding.
- **Manual Toil**: Organising tabs manually is time-consuming and often leads to frustration.

**TabWeaver** is built to solve this. It's not just a tab manager — it's an **Intelligent Knowledge Synthesis Assistant**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🤖 Intelligent Clustering
Stop manual sorting. Using the semantic powers of LLMs, TabWeaver automatically scans your open tabs and clusters them by **core themes and sub-topics**. You get a structured dashboard instead of a messy list of links.

### 2. 📝 Deep Synthesis
Enable deep analysis with one click. The system extracts key information across multiple pages to generate detailed "Page-by-Page Explanations" and "Integrated Analysis". It helps you identify **consensus, contradictions, and hidden insights** across different sources.

### 3. 🗺️ Content Visualization
Integrated with the Mermaid rendering engine, TabWeaver automatically generates **Content Flowcharts** for each page. Understand complex website structures and logic instantly through visual diagrams.

### 4. 🧹 Minimalist Management
After reading and organising through the dashboard, you can close all tabs under a specific topic with a single button. Keep your browser clean and your focus sharp.
